# 🏨 Atliq Grands - Business & Data Intelligence Dashboard 🚀

## 📘 Project Overview

Atliq Grands, a renowned chain of five-star hotels across India, has been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. Due to rising competition and ineffective decision-making, the company has experienced a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category.

To counter this, the management has decided to incorporate **Business and Data Intelligence** to regain their position. With no in-house analytics team, a third-party service provider (that’s us! 🙌) was hired to analyze historical data and derive actionable insights.
